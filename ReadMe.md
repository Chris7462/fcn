# Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation

## The Implementation of Fully Convolution Networks (FCN)
This repo is to implement the [FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038) in PyTorch. The model is based on CVPR'15 best paper.

## Dataset
The dataset is from the [PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2012](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/).

## How to Run
```python
python3 ./main.py
```
